# craigslist_clone

This Craigslist Clone scrapes my local craigslist site based on your search query and then dynamically generates a more attractive layout. 
If I continue this project in the future, I could code out views for every page rather than just the homepage. 
As it stands, when you click on one of thelistings on this clone, it just redirects you back to CL.<br>
